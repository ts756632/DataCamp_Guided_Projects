This is Aaron Judge. Judge is one of the physically largest players in Major League Baseball standing 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall and weighing 282 pounds (128 kg). He also hit the hardest home run ever recorded. How do we know this? Statcast.

Statcast is a state-of-the-art tracking system that uses high-resolution cameras and radar equipment to measure the precise location and movement of baseballs and baseball players. 



## **Business Task**

In this notebook, we're going to wrangle, analyze, and visualize Statcast data to compare Mr. Judge and another (extremely large) teammate of his. Let's start by loading the data into our Notebook. There are two CSV files, judge.csv and stanton.csv, both of which contain Statcast data for 2015-2017. 

### Tool used:
#### 1. Python: data wrangling and analysis
