Imagine working for a digital marketing agency, and the agency is approached by a massive online retailer of furniture. They want to test our skills at creating large campaigns for all of their website. We are tasked with creating a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section. The client says that they want us to generate keywords for the following products:

- sofas
- convertible sofas
- love seats
- recliners
- sofa beds


## **Business Task**

We will first need to generate a list of words, that together with the products given above would make for good keywords. Here are some examples:

Products: sofas, recliners
Words: buy, prices

The resulting keywords: 'buy sofas', 'sofas buy', 'buy recliners', 'recliners buy', 'prices sofas', 'sofas prices', 'prices recliners', 'recliners prices'.


As a final result, we want to have a DataFrame that looks like this:
