Our goals are to explore Super Bowl Data, view data distribution and answer key questions including:

1. What are the most extreme game outcomes?
2. How does the game affect television viewership?
3. How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
4. Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
